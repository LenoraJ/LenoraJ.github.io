    <p id="large-border">Hi. I am what humans call a <em>mixed</em> breed. In my case, that's part black lab, part beagle.
</br>
</br>
My mom and dad adopted me from a shelter in Howard County in February 2014. I was one-year-old at the time. I had been living with a family that had lots and lots of dogs and they just couldn't take care of me anymore.
</br>
</br>
The people at the shelter gave me the name Buckey but my new mom and dad decided to call me Rufus. That's okay by me, especially because it sounds like the noise I make when I speak. My new mom said we should celebrate my birthday on Valentine's Day and that my full name shall be Rufus Valentino. I like that a lot.
</br>
</br>
My new dad took me home in the middle of a snowstorm. I was shy and quiet at first in my new surroundings. Plus, there were two cats living in my new home. One of them is black and white and his name is Baxter. The other one is a little tortie called Lulu. I like them and would love to play with them but they just ignore me. That's okay too, because when my mom and dad have to go to work, they take me to a place they call <a href="http://www.cozycaninecamp.com" target="_blank">Doggie Day Care</a>. I call it my hangout, cuz that's where I hang out with my doggie friends.</p>
